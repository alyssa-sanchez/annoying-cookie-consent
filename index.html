					Want a great job in tech? Want a six-figure salary? Then you
					have come to the right place. I am going to tell you all you
					need to know to get all of that and much more, without you
					lifting a finger. You can learn passively. Just sit back,
					close your eyes, and let the sound of my voice make the code
					sink deep into your brain.
